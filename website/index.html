          We're looking phenomenal players to join us in our mythic progress in the legion raids.
          So do you have what it takes to progress the high-end content that World of Warcraft has to offer, the stability, patience an skill?
          Then we most likely have a spot for you on our raid team! <br>
          And if that shouldn't be what you're looking for but instead just want a place to hangout, you're very welcome too.

		    		Who is Limitation?
		    	</h1>
		    	<p id="forsidetekst">
            Limitation is a semi-hardcore raiding guild, with the purpose of pushing endgame content. We’re a bunch of players eager to push into mythic raiding, but have been held back by the size of our roster.
            We are always looking for good raiders, but first and foremost we’re looking for a stable 20-man roster.
            Since we’re a raiding guild there are bonuses of being a raider. Repairs, flasks, food, enchants, tomes and gems are all paid for by the guild, so you can focus more on raiding and less on the financials.
            We do other stuff than raiding, and it would be a rare sight for anyone to be online without having at least a few guildies to do dungeons, world quests or just talking with.
